# Create Scalable CD/CI pipeline to deploy ML model by using Azure Devops

### Objective  
Most of the time, the machine learning models are trained and developed in local Python notebook and the codes are provided to an app developer, who have to integrate it into an application and deploy it. It's common to see the bugs and the performance issue happened without noticing until the code has already been deployed.  
To tackle this problem, building Machine learning apps through Azure DevOps could be a good option. The whole process  becomes a part of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline of the Azure DevOps. Users can continue to write and train models in their favorite Python environment and  deployed the model to production without worrying about any conflicts between the app and the model.

### DevOps: Development and Operations
1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
2. Real-time monitoring
3. Collaborated platforms
4. Cloud agility
5. Orchestration
